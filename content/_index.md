## Hey There ðŸ‘‹

My name is Dave Fennessey. Iâ€™m a principal engineer working at Flink in Berlin (the one with the pink bikes).

I love the intersection of software architecture, foreign languages, and machine learning. My favorite feeling in the
world is starting a new GitHub project for a new idea.
